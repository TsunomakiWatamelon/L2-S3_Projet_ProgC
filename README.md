# L2-S3_Projet_ProgC

Project for "Initiation à la programmation en C" in 2nd year of Computer Science at Université Gustave Eiffel.

It is a tower defence game written in C using [libmlv](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~boussica/mlv/index.html). The goal of the project revolves around the usage of linked lists.

## Compilation

You need to have [libmlv](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~boussica/mlv/index.html) installed in your device to be able to compile the project. This library can be easily installed on linux with installation packages but it is much harder to install it on other platforms (MacOS / Windows).

A makefile is provided, you will need to execute the makefile in the src directory on the terminal.
```bash
make
```

## Usage

After the executable has been compiled, you can run the project in the src directory.
```bash
./chips_vs_virus
```

The project can either be played on the terminal or in a graphical window.

## State of the project

This project is very unlikely to be updated.
